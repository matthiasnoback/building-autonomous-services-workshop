# Make the *Stock* service autonomous

Currently, *Stock* needs *Purchase* and *Sales* to be responsive to do anything meaningful. This shouldn't be the case. By tuning into events produced by the other services, *Stock* could gather all the information needed to show the current stock level for all known products. This assignment is a bit more complicated than the first, but it's more rewarding too.

> This project's domain looks a bit like that of warehouse management software. Of course it's a simplified version. In our domain model, the following is true: 
>
> - The initial stock level of a product is 0.
> - The stock level of a product *increases* by the quantity that is being *received* for it (in the *Purchase* service).
> - The stock level of a product *decreases* by the quantity that is being *delivered* (in the *Sales* service).

1. Start with publishing events from the above-mentioned services when products are received or delivered. As event data, just provide everything you know (purchase order ID, sales order ID, product ID and quantity).
2. Set up a process manager for the *Stock* service:
    - Copy `src/Common/process_manager.php` to `src/Stock`.
    - Copy the `process_manager` service definition in [`docker-compose.consumers.yml`](../docker-compose.consumers.yml). Pick a different service name, and make sure it points to [`src/Stock/process_manager.php`](../src/Stock/process_manager.php) (instead of the one in `Common`).
3. Inside the consumer, take the information from incoming events, and create/update a `Balance` object for keeping track of the stock level (the class is already provided). Save it using `Database::persist()`. Note that, since every product will have exactly one balance, we can reuse the product ID as the ID of the `Balance`.
4. Take a look at what you have in your database (see the `.json` files in `var/`). You should now be able to modify `StockApplication::calculateStockLevels()` to no longer make an HTTP request to all services, but instead, query the objects you've created. Ensure that the response still looks like this:

```json
{
   "49319d56-b7b6-415d-b379-dde03d59e9b4": 5
}
```

It would be even smarter if *Stock* would already set up an empty `Balance` for every new product, for completeness sake. This should be achievable in the same way as in the first assignment: by letting the *Stock* consumer listen to the "product created" event from *Catalog*.

## Questions

- Events potentially increase coupling between services. An event exposes details about the internal domain model of a service. When consuming events, services gather knowledge about each other's internals. This can lead to something known as a "distributed monolith". There may be runtime autonomy, but there will be lots of violations of D.R.Y. (the *knowledge* aspect of it). Come up with a way to prevent this.
- *Stock* currently doesn't store the names of the products, would it be better if it would? Think of some reasons for or against it.
