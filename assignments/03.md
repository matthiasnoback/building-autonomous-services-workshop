# Dispatching new events inside consumers

Because *Stock* doesn't keep track of product names, *Dashboard* has to make two requests to show a list of current stock levels. You can improve the situation by taking the following steps.

First, make sure *Dashboard* tunes into the "product created" event too, so it can keep its own local list of products. This involves basically the same steps as you did in assignment 1.

Next, *Dashboard* needs to keep track of the current stock level too. However, it isn't (and shouldn't be) interested in how this stock level gets determined (i.e. it doesn't need to know about receiving and delivering goods). Instead, every time something changes about the current stock level, *Stock* should simply produce an event, like "stock level increased", or "stock level decreased", allowing *Dashboard* to know what the new stock level has become (and not why this happened in the first place).

Now,

1. Enhance the existing *Stock* consumer, to produce new events, "stock level increased" and "stock level decreased", after it has made changes to a `Balance` object.
2. Let *Dashboard* consume these events and store the latest stock level in its own database.

The *Dashboard* consumer can be a regular one, because it has no side-effects, so you can process all events again upon restart.
